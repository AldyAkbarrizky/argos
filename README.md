# Argos (Argo OS)

This is a learning project where I'm building a simplified operating system kernel from scratch using the Rust programming language.

## Goals

- Gain a deeper understanding of operating system fundamentals.
- Learn about low-level programming concepts like memory management, interrupts, and device drivers.
- Have fun experimenting and building something from the ground up!

## Current Features (It's Early Days!)

- Basic kernel initialization.
- Prints "Hello, World!" to the screen (VGA text mode).

## Future Plans (Ambitious but Exciting!)

- Implement a basic memory allocator.
- Handle keyboard interrupts.
- Create a simple file system.
- Explore process scheduling.

## Getting Started (For the Brave)

1. Install Rust: [https://www.rust-lang.org/](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
2. Install QEMU: [https://www.qemu.org/](https://www.qemu.org/)
3. Clone this repository.
4. Build the kernel (instructions coming soon!).
5. Run the kernel in QEMU (instructions coming soon!).

## Disclaimer

This is a work in progress and very much a learning experiment. It's not intended to be a production-ready operating system.
